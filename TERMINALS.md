# TERMINAL COMPARISON

## MacOS Terminal

TODO

## iTerm

*Pros*

* Lots of configuration knobs

*Cons*

* Too slow to run fullscreen on a 4K monitor
* Clicking iTerm icon in the Dock will move across spaces instead of opening a new iTerm window
* executable has no flags/options so not possible to set up keyboard shortcuts

## Alacritty

*Pros*

* fast enough to run neovim fullscreen on 4K monitor
* executable supports just enough arguments to support launch shortcuts

*Cons*

* Full-screen mode on MacOS (SimpleFullscreen) hides the Menu Bar and Dock which is on another monitor
* Command-~ shortcut to switch windows in the same app doesn't hop between Alacritty windows
* System keyboard shortcuts don't work in Alacritty so you need to duplicate each one into the alacritty.yml file

## Gnome-terminal

*Pros*

* executable supports enough arguments to support launch shortcuts
* TODO

*Cons*
