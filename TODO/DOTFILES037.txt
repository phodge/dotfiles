DOTFILES037 Ubuntu display issues/lag research

NOT caused by nvim or tmux or Wayland

Manifests in Alacritty at 320 columns OR large enough window size

gnome-terminal does not "lag" but sometimes has keystrokes that stay "pending" another keystroke arrives OR until screen is re-rendered

Note that my Desktop defaults to X11; if I log in with Wayland then I get
LLVMPipe graphics drivers and instead of lag I get very slow terminal
rendering.

I have been coding all day in Alacritty in fullscreen windows on X11 (nvidia graphics drivers) without perceptible lag
