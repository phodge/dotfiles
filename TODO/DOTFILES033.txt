DOTFILES033 CLOSED MAC investigate using skhd to install keyboard shortcuts on MacOS more easily

We did:

  $ brew install jackielii/tap/skhd-zig

We also want:

  skhd --install-service
  codesign --force --deep $(brew --prefix skhd-zig)/bin/skhd
  [Grant accessibility permissions to skhd in System Settings]

CLOSED: Tahoe is making it difficult to grant Accessibility permissions so this has become a non-starter.
