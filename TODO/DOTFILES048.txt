DOTFILES048 standardise keymaps that have LSP / TreeSitter functions

<F7>  Show usages of item under cursor (vim.lsp.buf.references)

i_<ctrl+space>  Perform autocompletion at the cursor.

<space>a  Split/join current line by arguments.
<space>i  Code Action (add missing import for name under cursor)
  - TODO: would like to split "code action" off into its own <space><space> and
    have <space>i just be the add-missing-import actions, which a prompt if
    there are multiple ways to do it.
<space>I  Sort imports
<space>d  Goto definition
  - Do we want to split this such that we get more distinction between "Go to
    the original implementation of this thing under the cursor" vs "Go to the
    place where this local identifier is initialised from something?" Keeping
    in mind we also have vim's 'gd' to do an unintelligent jump to the first
    occurence of the name in the current buffer
<space>h  Show help/docs (preferably via hover/popup) for item under cursor
<space>r  Rename item under cursor

??  Show man page for item under cursor (in split window)
??  LSP has a vim.lsp.buf.incoming_calls() that we might want to use?

\a  Jump to next ALE/Diagnostic error
\A  to toggle diagnostics on or off (is this really useful?)
\f  Autoformat current file


Jedi has a couple of other tricks that could be useful:
- jedi#goto_stubs()
- jedi#py_import() to open a module by module-name instead of file-name
