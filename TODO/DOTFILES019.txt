DOTFILES019 unify how we set filetype-related options

We have the following tasks to run per-buffer

- import-sort
- formatting (including import-sort)
- add missing import
- automatic fixers
- run linters and show errors in buffer, gutter, statusline, etc
- intelligent completion
- show method signature while editing
- jump to definition
- show references
