DOTFILES039 URGENT Personal Experiments Runner

- Experiment can be activated per ...
  - one github clone?
  - one project (github repo unique id)
  - single tmux session
  - one system
  - all systems

- Experiment has:
  - a duration (can be extended)
  - explanation of what features will behave differently
  - feedback Question(s) to ask at end of duration
  - mechanism to measure how many times the new feature was used
  - mechanism to measure how many times the new feature was successful

Also must have a mechanism at end of experiment period to ask whether the
experiment was successful, and whether I want to:
  A) run it again
    - either on the same or different basis (per project/per tmux session, etc)
  B) turn it on permanently
  C) turn it off permanently

Should also have a CLI to ...
- create a new experiment?
- show what experiments are in play
