DOTFILES020 MAC VALUE PRIORITY standardise OS keyboard shortcuts and script their installation

Worth checking whether skhd is an easier route for MacOS (see DOTFILES033)

- show all application windows (for this Desktop)
  - cmd+option+up
- move to next/prev Desktop
  - cmd+option+right
  - cmd+option+left

(These were previously managed through BTT)
option+left: maximise left half
option+shift+left: maximise left two-thirds
option+right: maximum right half
option+shift+right: maximum right one-thirds
option+down: move to next monitor


- open a terminal (ctrl+see DOTFILES031)
- ALSO can we have these shortcuts automatically reinstall on file save for fast customisation?


TODO: script this
- ask if MacOS keyboard shortcuts have been set
  - only ask once per system
- prompt to open System Preferences -> ... [where?]
  - prompt to add each keyboard shortcut
  - ask if was successful
