DOTFILES050 rethink fzf installation

- on MacOS I am successfully using g:use_vendored_fzf to load the fzf vim
  plugin modules from my dotfiles repo's submodule, but the fzf executable in
  $PATH is provided by homebrew.

- We almost certainly don't want to use the self-installing (download pre-build
  binary) mechanisms the plugin prompts us to use. I think we probably want to
  get rid of use_vendored_fzf altogether and just make sure ~/src/fzf.git has a
  known working version, but otherwise look at whatever fzf is in $PATH and set
  &rtp to its location.
