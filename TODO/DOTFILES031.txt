DOTFILES031 VALUE standardise CTRL+ALT+T for opening a terminal

To change default terminal on ubuntu you might use:

    sudo update-alternatives --config x-terminal-emulator


We want to have this shortcut on i3 as well

ALSO: can we install some custom shortcuts as well?

TODO: I need to get rid of the /usr/bin/alacritty-gogogo and remove it from update-alternatives

TODO: I also need to remove /snap/bin/alacritty from update-alternatives because it doesn't work
