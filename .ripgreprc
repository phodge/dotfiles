# this will cause ripgrep to search hidden folders like .github/ by default,
# but not all of .git or anything excluded by .gitignore
# XXX: this is a bit too slow for large projects. For big repos I might need to
# override $RIPGREP_CONFIG_PATH with a more lightweight config (one that
# doesn't use --hidden)
--hidden
--glob=!.git
# explicitly ignore .tags in case it isn't mentioned in a repo's .gitignore file
--glob=!.tags
--glob=!.tags.temp
